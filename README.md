# Time Series Analysis in Python - Predict Traffic on a New Mode of Transport


## Content

- **Understanding the data**
  - Hypotheses Generation - The following logical traffic hypotheses are generated to investgate the data
    - Traffic will increase as the years pass by (population increase overtime)
    - Traffic will be high from May to October (Tourist influx)
    - Traffic on weekdays will be more
    - Traffic during the peak hours will be high
  - Data Pre-Processing & Extracting Features
  - Exploratory Analysis (Investigate the hypotheses generated)
  - Splitting data into training and validation data
  
- **Model Techniques Explored in this Project**
  - Holt's Linear Trend Model
  - Holt Winter's Model
  - ARIMA Model
  - SARIMA Model
  
- **Tools Required**
  - Python 3.6 is used during development and the following tools are required to run the code provided in the jupyter notebook
    - Numpy
    - Pandas
    - Matplotlib    
    - Statsmodel
